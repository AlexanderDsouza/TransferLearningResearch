# Model Project Docker Setup
This project contains two Python scripts that run different machine learning models on the same input CSV file.

---

## Requirements

- Docker installed on your computer  
  Download and install from: https://www.docker.com/get-started

---

## How to build the Docker image
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder containing this README, Dockerfile, scripts, and CSV file.  
   Example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project-folder


Build the Docker image by running:

docker build -t abcd-project .

Run the LSTM model:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app abcd-project python jasonLSTM.py

Run the Transformer model:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app abcd-project python jasonTransformer.py



The input CSV file should be inside the project folder.
Output CSV files generated by the scripts will also be saved in this folder.
If you change any script, just rerun the command above; no need to rebuild the Docker image.
The -v "$PWD":/app flag mounts your current directory into the Docker container so files are accessible.

Note for Windows: If using PowerShell or CMD, replace "$PWD" with the full path in quotes, e.g.
-v "C:/Users/YourName/ProjectFolder:/app"
