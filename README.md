# Brain MRI Scanner Domain Adaptation

This project explores methods to build machine learning models that can transfer and adapt well between brain MRI scans from two different scanners. The goal is to improve model generalization and robustness across different scanner domains.

## Problem Overview

MRI scans from different scanners often vary in appearance and characteristics, making it challenging for models trained on one scannerâ€™s data to perform well on another. This project investigates techniques to bridge this domain gap.

## Data

- Brain MRI scans collected from **Scanner 1** and **Scanner 2**.

## Dataset

The project uses anonymized brain MRI scans from two scanners collected under approved protocols.  
Due to privacy and ethical considerations, the raw data cannot be publicly shared.  
Researchers interested in collaboration or data access may contact alexanderdanieldsouza@gmail.com.

## Methods

- Frozen Decoder.
- Frozen Predictor

## Results

- Accuracy measures of how each method performed on cross-scanner transfer tasks.
- Visualizations.
